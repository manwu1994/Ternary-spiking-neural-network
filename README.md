# Ternary-spiking-neural-network
This repository contains the implementation of the Ternary Spiking Neural Network (TSNN) architecture. The TSNN architecture offers significant model compression, achieving up to 16x compression compared to traditional neural networks. Moreover, it achieves impressive accuracy results on various datasets: 98.43% on N-MNIST, 89.07% on CIFAR-10, and 65.24% on CIFAR-100, using 4 time steps.
